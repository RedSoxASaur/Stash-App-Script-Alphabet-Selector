# Stash Userscript Alphabet Selector

This is a userscript for Stash App, that adds a button to the toolbar for an Alphabet keyboard, on Scenes, Movies, Performers, Studios and Tags page that when clicked adds a visible keyboard, allowing you to select letters or numerical value, that can either limit, aliases, name or both to whichever letter selected or number. And it will load the page limiting the view to where all aliases, names or both start with that letter or numerical value.

It's essentially a fancy bookmark for filter views and just uses regex to get the desired effect.

## Usage

Open and copy or load the Javascript into your favourite Userscript Manager, like Tampermonkey or Violent Monkey and change @match to point to the URL of your Stash configuration.
